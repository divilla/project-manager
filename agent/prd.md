# APIHydra Product Requirements Document

## Authority and status

- Product: APIHydra
- CLI command: `apih`
- Status: skeleton-aligned draft
- Binding reference: `skeleton/`

The checked-in skeleton is the authority for architecture, names, APIs, data,
and behavior. This PRD owns only the shared product contract identified below.
Package-local behavior belongs to the corresponding file in `agent/specs/`.
A specification may narrow an implementation choice only when the skeleton
already fixes that choice; it may not create behavior missing from the
skeleton.

## Product scope

APIHydra is a Go CLI for discovering YAML definitions in a directory tree,
decoding and validating those definitions, resolving inherited request
defaults, preparing request steps, executing requests, and validating
responses.

The current reference CLI implements the definition pipeline only. Execution
types and services are part of the reference API but are not yet composed by
`cmd/cli`.

## Package ownership

The repository has these reference packages and no parallel service or model
hierarchy:

| Package | Owned responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `cmd/cli` | Working-directory selection, service composition, fatal-diagnostic routing, and process exit. |
| `internal/domain` | Shared suite, directory, file, definition, defaults, and step values. |
| `internal/definition` | Directory/file loading, document classification, definition decoding and validation, and resolution. |
| `internal/execution` | The key-value store, variable phases, response validation, step preparation, and staged execution. |
| `internal/reporter` | Human-readable terminal output through injected writers. |
| `pkg/errs` | Contextual error construction and exit-code metadata. |
| `pkg/runner` | External-command operations. |

The architecture test makes three ownership rules enforceable:

- production command execution is confined to `pkg/runner`;
- production contextual error composition with `fmt.Errorf` or `errors.Join`
  is confined to `pkg/errs`;
- production terminal writes are confined to `internal/reporter`.

`bat` and a `BatDiff` API are expressly absent.

## Shared domain contract

This section owns the shared data vocabulary used by every package spec. Specs
reference it rather than restating fields.

### Documents

`domain.DocumentKind` has exactly these values:

```go
const (
    KindRoot     DocumentKind = "root"
    KindDefaults DocumentKind = "defaults"
    KindSteps    DocumentKind = "steps"
)
```

`BaseDefinition` contains `App`, `Kind`, and raw `Spec`.
`DefaultsDefinition` and `StepsDefinition` contain `App`, `Kind`, `Metadata`,
`Spec`, and source `File`. `Metadata` contains `Name` and `Labels`.

### Suite tree

One run uses one `domain.Suite` containing `WorkDir` and `Root`. A `Directory`
contains:

- `Stage`, `Path`, `Parent`, and `Children`;
- `Files`, `DefaultsFile`, and `StepsFiles`;
- `DefaultsDefinition` and `StepsDefinitions`;
- `ResolvedDefaults`, `ResolvedSteps`, and `RuntimeSteps`.

A `File` contains `Stage`, `Path`, `Kind`, `Bytes`, and its owning `Directory`.
Directory paths are relative to `Suite.WorkDir`; the root path is `/`.

### Defaults and steps

`Defaults` has exactly `BaseURL`, `BasePath`, `Headers`, `Timeout`, and
`Retries` with the YAML names defined in `skeleton/internal/domain/suite.go`.

`Step` has exactly the reference fields under `Vars`, `Request`, `Response`,
and `Debug`, plus source `Definition` and `Index`. Fields typed as
`YAMLString` remain `YAMLString`; specs must not replace them with parallel
presence or arbitrary-value wrappers.

The JSON names on declarative and runtime step fields match their YAML names.
`Definition` is omitted from JSON and `Index` is encoded as `index`.
`DirectoryStage`, `DirectoryPath`, and `FilePath` derive provenance through
`Step.Definition.File.Directory` exactly as implemented by the skeleton.

## Current reference CLI contract

`skeleton/cmd/cli.run` starts with `os.Getwd()`. If a first positional argument
exists, it joins that argument to the current directory and requires the result
to be a directory. Invalid input returns configuration code `102` and an error
matching CLI-owned `InvalidPathError`.

The reference CLI creates separate Reporters for `os.Stdout` and `os.Stderr`. `run`
reports the selected working directory, creates
`domain.Suite{WorkDir: workDir}`, and invokes:

1. `Loader.LoadDirectoryStructure`
2. `Loader.LoadDirectoryFiles`
3. `Loader.DecodeBaseDefinitions`
4. `Decoder.DecodeFiles`
5. `Decoder.ValidateDefaultsDefinitions`
6. `Decoder.ValidateStepsDefinitions`
7. `Resolver.ResolveDefaults`
8. `Resolver.ResolveSteps`

The reference `run` returns success after step resolution. A returned error is
passed to the stderr Reporter's `Error` method, after which `main` exits with
the code returned by `run`.

## Exit-code contract

The product reserves:

| Constant | Code | Meaning |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| `errs.ExitSuccess` | `0` | Success. |
| `errs.ExitValidation` | `101` | Execution completed with validation failure. |
| `errs.ExitConfiguration` | `102` | Invocation or configuration failure. |
| `errs.ExitInternal` | `103` | Internal failure. |

The construction and lookup semantics for coded errors are owned by
[`02-errs-pkg.md`](specs/02-errs-pkg.md). Package specs must reference that
contract instead of redefining contextual error formatting.

## Specification ownership

Package-local requirements are owned in one place:

| Contract | Owning specification |
| --- | --- |
| External-command functions | [`01-runner-pkg.md`](specs/01-runner-pkg.md) |
| Contextual errors | [`02-errs-pkg.md`](specs/02-errs-pkg.md) |
| Loader | [`03-loader-service.md`](specs/03-loader-service.md) |
| Decoder | [`04-decoder-service.md`](specs/04-decoder-service.md) |
| Resolver | [`05-resolver-service.md`](specs/05-resolver-service.md) |
| KeyValueStore | [`06-key-value-store-service.md`](specs/06-key-value-store-service.md) |
| VariableProcessor | [`07-variable-processor.md`](specs/07-variable-processor.md) |
| Validator | [`08-validator.md`](specs/08-validator.md) |
| Preparation and execution phase order, tree validation, and stage scheduling | [`09-step-runner.md`](specs/09-step-runner.md) |
| Reporter methods and output fixed by the reference implementation | [`10-reporter.md`](specs/10-reporter.md) |

No spec restates another spec's normative behavior. A consumer spec references
the owner and states only how its own API participates.

## Not specified by the skeleton

The following are not product requirements:

- definition placement/cardinality rules beyond the reference fields and
  service comments;
- deterministic file ordering or symlink/hidden-directory policy;
- presence-sensitive default merging, implicit HTTP methods, URL
  normalization, or header canonicalization;
- variable syntax, scope, serialization, interpolation, or capture-storage
  lifetime;
- response-type tokens/modifiers, projection rules, HTTP-status behavior, or
  exact validation algorithms;
- exact curl, jq, or Git argument vectors and command-result normalization;
- success, validation-failure, or debug layouts not implemented or tested in
  `skeleton/`;
- debug winner selection or execution-stop semantics;
- name/label filters, preflight APIs, events, summaries, or additional CLI
  flags;
- additional packages, services, models, fields, methods, static errors, or
  exit codes.

An implementation choice in one of these areas does not become a contract
until the protected skeleton is explicitly revised and the PRD/spec owner is
updated to match.

## Acceptance criteria

1. Production packages compile against the exact reference names, types, and
   method signatures without adapters that create a competing API.
2. The current CLI follows the eight definition phases in order and does not
   compose the execution pipeline prematurely.
3. Shared workflow state uses `internal/domain` rather than parallel carriers.
4. Command execution, contextual error composition, and terminal output remain
   within their owner packages.
5. Every package-local behavior is specified once and referenced by consumers.
6. No behavior listed as unspecified is asserted by a package spec.
7. `go test ./...`, `go test -race ./...`, and `git diff --check` pass.
