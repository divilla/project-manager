name: change-code
description: Implement a supplied specification in an existing codebase, including contract checks, production code, acceptance tests, and verification. Use for `$change-code` requests containing an inline specification or identifying a specification file, issue, document, or URL.

# Change Code

Treat the text after `$change-code` as the specification argument. Read any
referenced file, issue, document, or URL before editing, and treat the rest of
the request as constraints.

## Establish the contract

1. Read `AGENTS.md`, `skeleton/`, `agent/prd.md`, the supplied specification,
   and `agent/architecture.md` before acting.
2. Resolve conflicts in this order: `AGENTS.md` > `skeleton/` >
   `agent/prd.md` > supplied specification > `agent/architecture.md`.
3. Inspect repository status plus the relevant implementation, tests,
   documentation, and build commands. Preserve unrelated user changes.
4. Treat protected references and declared contracts as binding. If the change
   conflicts with them or requires modifying them, stop before editing, report
   the exact mismatch, and request explicit direction. Never work around them.

## Implement

1. Extract behavior, acceptance criteria, edge cases, public-contract effects,
   and validation into a short checklist.
2. Resolve details from repository evidence. Ask only when an unresolved choice
   would materially change the contract or result.
3. Implement the architecture, types, and naming defined in `skeleton/`
   exactly. Within that contract, use the narrowest existing extension points
   and match current formatting and error handling.
4. Make the smallest complete production change, including affected tests,
   documentation, and fixtures. Avoid unrelated cleanup and speculative design.
5. Do not introduce a public or shared type, function, method, schema, or other
   external contract until the repository's contract-change process is met.
6. Give every acceptance-criteria bullet a meaningful test. Avoid redundant
   tests unless they prove a distinct criterion or regression.

## Verify

Run formatting and targeted tests first, then all repository-required checks
and coverage thresholds. Inspect the final diff for accidental edits, missing
criteria, contract drift, and generated-file requirements. Fix failures caused
by the change; report the exact command and evidence for unrelated failures.

Declare completion only when every criterion is implemented and tested,
contracts remain aligned, and required checks pass. Summarize the behavior,
verification, and any remaining limitation with links to key files.
