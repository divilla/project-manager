Fix gzip middleware to respect `q=0` values in the `Accept-Encoding` header.

## Problem

According to RFC 9110, an encoding with `q=0` is explicitly unacceptable. The current implementation does not respect this quality value and may enable gzip even when the client sends:

```http
Accept-Encoding: gzip;q=0
```

## Solution

Update the gzip negotiation logic to honor `q=0` quality values and skip gzip when it is explicitly marked as unacceptable.

## Testing

- added a regression test covering `Accept-Encoding: gzip;q=0`
- `go test ./middleware`'

## What

`findStaticChild` scanned `[]*node` and dereferenced every child just to read its one-byte label — a pointer chase per static step on the routing hot path. This adds a parallel `scLabels []byte` (kept in sync in `addStaticChild`, `newNode`, the insert split, and `Remove`) and scans that contiguous slice instead, indexing into `staticChildren` only on a hit.

It also folds the is-leaf recomputation — previously duplicated across 5 sites, with the `Remove` copy subtly using `len()==0` while the others used `== nil` — into a single `refreshLeaf()` helper that uses `len()`, so it is correct whether `staticChildren` is `nil` or an emptied-but-non-nil slice left after a removal.

        'Per @aldas''s request, this PR is now JSON-only. The router change moved to #3024.

## What

`DefaultJSONSerializer.Deserialize` used `json.NewDecoder(body).Decode()`, which allocates a decoder and its internal read buffer on every JSON request. It now reads the body into a capped pooled buffer and decodes with `json.Unmarshal`; `Unmarshal` does not retain the input slice, so the buffer is safe to reuse. The pool drops oversized buffers (>64 KiB) so a single large body cannot pin memory.

## Numbers

`BenchmarkBind_JSON`: 1008 → 312 B/op (**-69%**), 9 → 7 allocs, ~12% faster.

## Behavioral note

`json.Unmarshal` is stricter than streaming `Decode` — it rejects trailing data after the first top-level value and reports `"unexpected end of JSON input"` for truncated bodies (both still 400 Bad Request). Two bind tests asserting the old `"unexpected EOF"` message are updated to match. Covered by new tests in `json_test.go` (trailing-data rejection, pooled-buffer reuse/concurrency under `-race`, the >64 KiB cap path, and body-read errors).

## DoS note (from review)

The full body is read into memory before decoding. The previous `json.Decoder` path also fully materialized any *valid* large body, so the only real delta is a malformed-early huge body. The correct guard for untrusted input is `middleware.BodyLimit` / `http.MaxBytesReader`, which makes the read here fail fast — documented on `Deserialize`.

This PR also adds the general ServeHTTP/JSON benchmark harness (`perf_bench_test.go`) used to measure both this and #3024.

-----------

Make serving static file releated methods  and middleware not unescape path by default - so how the way Router interprets paths and Static methods/middleware is consistent.

Given following situation:
```go
// 0.
// given folder structure:
// private.txt
// public/
// public/index.html
// public/text.txt
// public/admin/private.txt

// 1. share `public/` folder contents from the server root. This folder actually contains subfolder `admin` which
// contents we want to forbid from downloading
e.Static("/", "public")

// 2. naively assume that everything under /admin folder is now forbidden
e.GET("/admin/*", func(c *Context) error {
    return ErrForbidden
})
```

Then requests to `/admin%2fprivate.txt` would not be matched to `GET /admin/*` route (routing does not look unescaped path) and static file serving will use unescaped path to serve the file.

Note: this way of "guarding" subfolders will never work for for paths like `/assets/../admin%2fprivate.txt` which will `path.Clean("/assets/../admin%2fprivate.txt")` to `/admin/private.txt` and are servable if static file serving is configured to unescape paths.

If you want to guard routes - use middlewares on `Static*` methods and before `Static` middleware.

 **Breaking change / migration:** If you serve files whose names contain URL-encoded characters (e.g., `/hello%20world.txt` → `hello world.txt`), you must now opt in:

```go
	e := echo.New()
	e.EnablePathUnescapingStaticFiles = true  // <-- enable old behavior
	e.Static("/", "public")
```
for static middleware
```go
	e.Use(middleware.StaticWithConfig(middleware.StaticConfig{
		EnablePathUnescaping: true, // <-- enable old behavior
	}))

        '## Summary

Fixes **GHSA-3pmx-cf9f-34xr**, a bypass of the GHSA-vfp3-v2gw-7wfq fix (#3009).

The router matches the raw, still-encoded request path, so encoded separators and dot segments in a static wildcard are not treated as traversal during routing. Unescaping them in the static file resolver afterwards let an unauthenticated attacker read a file across a route-level middleware guard the encoded path never matched:

- `/public/%2E%2E/admin/secret.txt` → `admin/secret.txt` — **high severity, default router**
- `/public%2F..%2Fadmin%2Fsecret.txt` under `UseEscapedPathForMatching=true`, where the router decodes the path itself before the handler sees it — lower severity (non-default config)

Both returned `200` + the protected file on `master` at `5786024` (the exact commit the advisory tested).

## Approach

Rather than keep extending an encoding denylist (the original fix blocked `%2F`/`%5C` but missed `%2E%2E`), this addresses the root cause: **make static path unescaping opt-in.** This follows @aldas''s proposal (`e85ee8f`), rebased onto current `master`.

- **echo:** `Config.EnablePathUnescapingStaticFiles` (default `false`) controls unescaping for `Echo.Static`/`StaticFS` and `Group.Static`/`StaticFS`.
- **middleware:** `StaticConfig.EnablePathUnescaping` replaces the now-deprecated `DisablePathUnescaping`; the default is the safe, no-unescape mode.

With unescaping off, `%2F`/`%5C`/`%2E%2E` stay literal and never become separators or traversal.

As defense in depth — and to also close the `UseEscapedPathForMatching` variant, where the **router** (not the handler) does the decoding — any `..` path segment in the resolved wildcard is rejected via `pathutil.HasDotDotSegment`, mirroring the `fs.ValidPath` "no `..` element" invariant. The existing encoded-separator guard remains as a backstop on the opt-in unescaping path.

## Verification

| Variant | `master` (5786024) | this PR |
|---|---|---|
| `/public/%2E%2E/admin/secret.txt` (default router) | 200 `TOP-SECRET` | **404** |
| `/public%2F..%2Fadmin%2Fsecret.txt` (`UseEscapedPathForMatching`) | 200 `TOP-SECRET` | **404** |
| middleware equivalents (both router modes) | 200 `TOP-SECRET` | **404** |

Regression tests cover both variants in both router modes, the opt-in mode (encoded `%20` filenames serve, but `%2F`/`..` still rejected), and `pathutil.HasDotDotSegment` units. `go test -race ./...` and `go vet ./...` pass.

## ⚠️ Breaking change

Static files whose names contain URL-encoded characters (e.g. `"hello world.txt"` via `/hello%20world.txt`) are **no longer served by default**. Set `EnablePathUnescapingStaticFiles` (echo) / `EnablePathUnescaping` (middleware) to opt back in. Because this flips a default, suggest releasing as **5.3.0** with an upgrade note rather than a patch.

## Notes for reviewers

- Omitted the `RawPath`-preferring directory-redirect tweak from `e85ee8f` to keep this scoped to the vuln; happy to fold it in.
- cc @aldas — this takes your disable-by-default approach plus the `..` rejection needed to close the `UseEscapedPathForMatching` variant your patch didn''t reach.

## Summary
An encoded path separator (`%2F` or `%5C`) in a static file URL could bypass route-level access control and disclose files. The router matches against the raw, still-encoded path, so `%2F` is not a separator — `/admin%2Fsecret.txt` skips a protected `/admin/*` group, falls through to static serving, which then unescaped `%2F`→`/` and served `admin/secret.txt`.

v4 is affected on **both** static surfaces:
- `echo_fs.go` `StaticDirectoryHandler` (used by `Static`/`StaticFS`) — vulnerable to `%2F` **and** `%5C` (it used OS-specific `filepath.Clean`).
- `middleware/static.go` — vulnerable to `%2F` (it already used `path.Clean`, so not `%5C`).

## Fix
- Both surfaces reject a wildcard containing an encoded separator (`%2F`/`%2f` or `%5C`/`%5c`) with `404` before unescaping, via a shared `internal/pathutil` helper.
- `StaticDirectoryHandler` switched from `filepath.Clean`+`ToSlash` to `path.Clean` (OS-independent; keeps backslash literal on Windows).

## Tests
- New regression tests for `%2F`, `%5C`, double-encoded `%252F`, group `StaticFS`, and the static middleware on a group; unit test for the detector.
- Updated two existing cases (`open redirect vulnerability`, `Directory redirect#01`) that asserted the old `%2f`-unescaped redirect — they now correctly assert `404` + no `Location`.
- `go test -race ./...` and `go vet ./...` pass.

Fixes an access-control bypass / static file disclosure where an **encoded slash (`%2F`) lets a request skip a protected route group yet still resolve the file on disk** (GHSA-vfp3-v2gw-7wfq, CWE-22).

The router matches routes against the raw, still-encoded request path, so `%2F` is **not** treated as a path separator — `/admin%2Fsecret.txt` is a single segment and never matches a protected `/admin/*` group. The request falls through to the static handler, which then `url.PathUnescape`d `%2F` back to `/` and resolved `admin/secret.txt` from disk. Router and file handler disagreed on what counts as a separator.

### Reproduction (before)
```
GET /admin/secret.txt    -> 403  (protected group fires)
GET /admin%2Fsecret.txt  -> 200  body="TOP-SECRET"   ← bypass + disclosure
```

Common affected pattern:
```go
adminGroup := e.Group("/admin", authMiddleware)
e.StaticFS("/", os.DirFS("public"))
```

## Fix

`StaticDirectoryHandler` now rejects a wildcard containing an encoded path separator (`%2F`/`%2f` or `%5C`/`%5c`) with `404` **before** unescaping, keeping the router and the file handler consistent. No real filename contains a path separator, so legitimate static requests are unaffected.

## Tests
- New `static_encoded_separator_test.go`: regression test for the bypass + unit test for the `%2F`/`%5C` detector (incl. lower-case hex and a benign `%25` case).
- Updated the existing `TestEcho_StaticFS` "open redirect" case: `…%2f..` now returns `404` with **no redirect emitted at all** (was a sanitized `301`), which closes that vector harder.
- `go test ./ ./middleware/` and `go vet ./` pass.

## Scope / notes

Optimizes Echo''s per-request hot paths to remove avoidable allocations and CPU work. **No public API changes; the standard-library JSON serializer remains the default.** All numbers are `benchstat` medians (n=8, Apple M3 Max / arm64, Go 1.26).

## What changed

**Core**
- **Middleware chain compiled once** (`echo.go`, `buildRouterChains`) and reused, instead of re-wrapping closures on every request. Routing stores the matched handler on the `Context`.
- **Context** (`context.go`): zero-copy `String`/`HTML`/`JSONP` writes (write-only `unsafe` view), reuse of `delayedStatusWriter` (guarded against re-entrant `c.JSON`) and the store map across requests, inline `Get`/`Set` unlock, and a single-key `QueryParam` fast path proven byte-for-byte equal to `url.ParseQuery().Get` (incl. malformed escapes / `;` / `+`).
- **Binder** (`bind.go`): per-`reflect.Type` field-metadata cache so struct tags are parsed once per type, not per request. Preserves the field-name error wrapping from #3005.
- **Middleware**: precompute the HSTS header once (`secure.go`); pool the request-ID `randomString` scratch buffers (`util.go`).
- New hot-path benchmark suite + pooling/dispatch regression tests.
- `test:` de-flake `TestStartConfig_WithListenerNetwork` (ephemeral port instead of a hard-coded one) — separable commit; fixes a pre-existing CI flake.

## Performance (before → after)

Headline: the middleware path and the `Set`/`QueryParam` paths are now **allocation-free**; binding is **28–48% faster**.

## Router — profiled, intentionally untouched

`-cpuprofile` shows the router is already **0 allocs/op**, with time dominated by the irreducible LCP byte-loop (58%) and method switch (11%). I implemented the httprouter `indices`/`IndexByte` trick for `findStaticChild` and **measured a 30–37% regression** on hits — Echo''s nodes have small fan-out, where the inlined linear scan beats a non-inlined `IndexByte` call — so it was reverted. No router change.

## Using a faster JSON encoder (e.g. sonic)

This PR does not bundle sonic. The `echo.JSONSerializer` interface already lets any app swap encoders in ~10 lines:

```go
import "github.com/bytedance/sonic"

type sonicJSON struct{}
func (sonicJSON) Serialize(c *echo.Context, v any, _ string) error {
	b, err := sonic.Marshal(v); if err != nil { return err }
	_, err = c.Response().Write(b); return err
}
func (sonicJSON) Deserialize(c *echo.Context, v any) error {
	return sonic.ConfigDefault.NewDecoder(c.Request().Body).Decode(v)
}
// e.JSONSerializer = sonicJSON{}
```

Measured (this machine, arm64): sonic **decode −44%** (a clear win on any arch), **encode +43%** (arm64 is sonic''s weak arch; usually a win on amd64). A full cookbook example with these caveats will be a separate PR to labstack/echox.

## Testing

- `go test ./...` + `-race` pass; `gofmt` + `go vet` clean.
- Added: store no-leak across `Reset`, JSON status across `Reset`, nested `c.JSON`, global/pre middleware on 404/405/OPTIONS, `randomString` concurrency, query fast-path stdlib-equivalence.',

The rate limiter sets no `Retry-After` / `X-RateLimit-*` headers, and the `RateLimiterStore` interface (`Allow(identifier) (bool, error)`) gives a store no way to set them either.

## Fix

Add an **optional** interface:

```go
type RateLimiterStoreContext interface {
	AllowContext(c *echo.Context, identifier string) (bool, error)
}
```

When the configured store implements it, the middleware calls `AllowContext` (with the request context) instead of `Allow`, so the store can set response headers on the allow/deny decision.

**Fully backward compatible** — stores implementing only `Allow` are unaffected; the existing interface and the built-in memory store are unchanged.

This is the optional-interface approach @aldas proposed in the issue thread (mirroring the pattern used in the v4 proxy middleware). It intentionally does **not** retrofit the built-in store with full metadata plumbing (the part flagged as a larger rewrite in the thread) — it just provides the hook so stores can set headers.

## Test

`TestRateLimiter_storeAllowContextIsPreferred` (written first; fails before the change): a store implementing `AllowContext` is preferred over `Allow` and can set a `Retry-After` header. gofmt/vet clean; full rate-limiter suite passes (backward compat confirmed).

Addresses #2961.

A file whose name contains a percent sign cannot be downloaded via the static middleware:

- `100%.txt` → `GET /100%25.txt` → **`invalid URL escape "%.t"`** (500)
- `foo%20bar.txt` → `GET /foo%2520bar.txt` → serves the wrong/missing file

`http.Request.URL.Path` is **already decoded** by net/http (per its docs), but the middleware unescaped it a second time.

## Fix

Default `pathUnescape` to `false`. The non-group path comes from `URL.Path` (already decoded), so it must not be unescaped again. Only the wildcard param from a group route (`c.Param("*")`, set explicitly) may still be escaped, and that case keeps its existing `DisablePathUnescaping` toggle — so group behavior is unchanged.

```
GET /100%25.txt       → 200  "hundred percent"
GET /foo%2520bar.txt  → 200  "literal percent twenty"
```

## Test

`TestStatic_servesFileWithPercentInName` (written first; fails on master with 500) using an in-memory `fstest.MapFS`. gofmt/vet clean; all `TestStatic*` and the full middleware package pass (group/`DisablePathUnescaping` cases unaffected).

When `c.Bind()` fails a type conversion on form/struct data, the error gives no indication of *which* field failed:

```
POST /submit  number=10a
→ code=400, message=Bad Request, err=strconv.ParseInt: parsing "10a": invalid syntax
```

This makes it hard to render a useful validation message ("the `number` field must be an integer").

## Fix

`bindData` already has the field name (`inputFieldName`) in scope at each conversion site but returned the bare error. Wrap those returns with the field name using `%w` (so `errors.Is`/`errors.As` still work):

```
→ code=400, message=Bad Request, err=number: strconv.ParseInt: parsing "10a": invalid syntax
```

This is the wrap the reporter proposed in the thread (`fmt.Errorf("%s: %w", inputFieldName, err)`), applied to all four conversion-error sites (unmarshaler, slice element, scalar).

## Test

`TestBind_formConversionErrorIncludesFieldName` (written first; fails on master — error contains no field name). Four existing tests that asserted the bare message are updated to the field-prefixed form. gofmt/vet clean; full root-package suite passes.

A binding error returned from a handler is serialized as `{"message":"Bad Request"}` — the field name **and** the binder message are both lost.

### Root cause
`BindingError` embeds `*HTTPError` but does not implement `json.Marshaler`. In `DefaultHTTPErrorHandler` the type switch runs on the `HTTPStatusCoder` extracted via `errors.As`, whose dynamic type is `*BindingError`. Go''s `case *HTTPError` matches only the exact type, so a `*BindingError` falls through to the `default` branch → `{"message": http.StatusText(code)}`. Regression from fbfe216 (#2456).

Verified on current `master`:
```
GET /doc?docNum=abc  →  400  {"message":"Bad Request"}
```

## Fix

Implement `MarshalJSON` on `*BindingError` so it takes the handler''s existing `case json.Marshaler` branch (which is checked *before* `*HTTPError`). Restores the v4.10.2 structured response:
```
GET /doc?docNum=abc  →  400  {"field":"docNum","message":"failed to bind field value to int"}
```

This is the approach the maintainer outlined in the issue thread ("we could make `echo.BindingError` … implement `json.Marshaler`").

        '## What

Adds `group_method_handling_test.go`: tests that lock in v5''s method-handling semantics for routes registered through a `Group`, and act as a regression gate for changes that would reintroduce an implicit per-group catch-all (e.g. #2996, which restores it to fix CORS-on-group preflight).

## Behavior asserted (verified on `master`)

| Request on a `GET`-only group route | v5 today |
|---|---|
| `POST /api/users` | **405** + `Allow: OPTIONS, GET` |
| `OPTIONS /api/users` | **204** + `Allow: OPTIONS, GET` (preflight-relevant) |
| `GET /api/users` | 200 |
| `GET /health` (root) | 200, unaffected by the group |

## Why these are real gates

A group-level catch-all — whether registered manually via `g.RouteNotFound("/*", …)` or automatically (as in #2996) — matches **every** method, which masks both the 405 and the automatic OPTIONS response as **404**. Verified empirically: with such a catch-all, `POST` and `OPTIONS` on `/api/users` both return 404. The first two tests would catch that regression.

## Note

This replaces an earlier version of this PR whose comments described a middleware-triggered "auto catch-all" that does not exist on `master` (v5) — the tests passed for the wrong reason. Reworked after review to assert the actual, verified behavior and drop the inert no-op middleware. All four tests pass; gofmt- and vet-clean.

        '## Summary

Fix `Decompress` so middleware after it does not keep using the compressed request size after the body has been replaced with the decoded gzip stream.

For example:

```go
e.Use(middleware.Decompress())
e.Use(middleware.BodyLimit(4))
```

A gzipped request whose decoded body is `ok` should pass:

```bash
printf "ok" | gzip | curl -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: text/plain" \
  -H "Content-Encoding: gzip" \
  --data-binary @- \
  http://localhost:8080/
```

Before this change, `Decompress` replaced `req.Body` but left `req.ContentLength` set to the compressed size, so `BodyLimit` could reject the request before reading it:

```text
{"message":"Request Entity Too Large"}
```

With this change, `Decompress` sets `req.ContentLength = -1` after gzip decompression is set up, so downstream middleware enforces limits while reading the decoded body:

```text
ok
```

This intentionally does not change `Content-Encoding`, `GetBody`, or multiple content-coding behavior.

This PR fixes https://github.com/labstack/echo/issues/2993

The proxy middleware''s WebSocket path currently sets `X-Forwarded-For` only when the header is empty, dropping the proxy''s own peer IP from the chain whenever upstream proxies had already added entries. This breaks downstream services that rely on the "rightmost untrusted" rule to extract the real client IP, including echo''s own `ExtractIPFromXFFHeader`.

The HTTP path delegates to `net/http/httputil.ReverseProxy`, which appends `RemoteAddr` to the existing `X-Forwarded-For` chain — either inline in `ServeHTTP`''s default Director path ([reverseproxy.go#L519-L531](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/go1.26.3/src/net/http/httputil/reverseproxy.go#L519-L531)) or via the explicit [`(*ProxyRequest).SetXForwarded`](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/go1.26.3/src/net/http/httputil/reverseproxy.go#L82-L96)
when a `Rewrite` callback is configured. The WebSocket path uses `proxyRaw`,
which writes the request verbatim via `r.Write(out)`, so this middleware is the only place where the appending happens for WebSocket Upgrade requests.

## Change

Replace the "set if empty" guard with always-append. Read values via map access to preserve multi-line `X-Forwarded-For` headers (RFC 9110 §5.3 allows combining them by joining values with commas).

## Test

Added TestProxyWebSocketXForwardedFor exercising 4 cases:

- no incoming X-Forwarded-For → only c.RealIP()
- single-line single-entry → preserved + c.RealIP() at the tail
- single-line comma-separated → preserved + c.RealIP() at the tail
- multi-line headers (multiple X-Forwarded-For occurrences) → joined with , + c.RealIP() at the tail

Each case captures the request header at WebSocket Upgrade time inside the upstream handler and asserts both the appended tail and the preserved prefix.

## Backwards compatibility

The change is additive: existing entries are preserved and the proxy''s own peer IP is added at the tail. Downstream readers using the standard "rightmost untrusted" rule (e.g. echo.ExtractIPFromXFFHeader) see no behavioral difference for chains where they already worked, and start returning the correct IP for chains where the proxy IP was previously
dropped.

## Background

We hit this in production with an Echo-based WebSocket reverse proxy fronting an internal service that uses echo.ExtractIPFromXFFHeader for IP-based authorization. Multi-hop deployments (customer proxy → our reverse proxy → backend) broke because the reverse proxy''s egress IP was missing from the chain reaching the backend.',

Rate limit middleware now sets standard rate limit response headers when using the built-in `RateLimiterMemoryStore`:

- `X-RateLimit-Limit` — configured burst
- `X-RateLimit-Remaining` — tokens remaining after the request
- `Retry-After` — seconds until the next token is available (on 429 only)

Implementation follows the maintainer suggestion from the issue: an optional unexported `rateLimiterStoreContext` interface with `AllowContext(c echo.Context, identifier string) (bool, error)`. When the configured store implements it, the middleware calls it instead of `Allow`. Custom stores can opt in without breaking the existing `RateLimiterStore` API.

`Retry-After` is computed via `rate.Limiter.ReserveN(...).Delay()` as suggested in the issue discussion.

## What
Updated `README.md` to fix three user-facing documentation issues: the installation snippet now uses a valid shell comment marker inside the `sh` code block, the `slog-echo` entry now links to the current standard-library `log/slog` package documentation instead of the retired `x/exp/slog` path, and the third-party middleware guidance sentence has a small grammar correction.

## Why
These changes remove small but real sources of friction in the first-touch documentation. The `//` line inside a shell block is misleading if copied verbatim, and the outdated `slog` link points readers at a pre-standard-library package path. The grammar fix keeps contributor-facing guidance polished without changing behavior.

## Testing
No code tests were run because this is a README-only change. Verification was done by inspecting the rendered diff and ensuring the updated commands and links are syntactically correct.

## Risk

This adds an **optional `AutoHead` flag** that automatically enables HEAD requests for any GET route. No need to define separate HEAD handlers anymore.

## Why this is useful

Right now, if you want proper HEAD support, you have to manually add a HEAD route for every GET route. That leads to:

* Repeated boilerplate
* Easy-to-miss HEAD routes (resulting in 405 errors)
* Inconsistent headers like missing `Content-Length`

According to HTTP spec (RFC 7231), HEAD should behave like GET without a body — so this just makes Echo handle that for you.

## How it works

When `AutoHead` is turned on:

* Every GET route automatically gets a HEAD equivalent
* The same handler runs, but the response body is suppressed
* Headers and status code are preserved
* `Content-Length` is still set correctly
* If you’ve defined a HEAD route manually, it won’t be overridden

## Implementation notes

* Added `AutoHead` to `Echo` and `Config`
* Wrapped handlers using a custom response writer
* Hooked into route registration (`add()`) to register HEAD routes

## Usage

```go
e := echo.New()
e.AutoHead = true

e.GET("/api/users", handler)
// HEAD /api/users now works automatically
```

## Performance

Very small overhead:

* ~532 ns per request
* 3 allocations

No impact if the feature is disabled (default).

## Testing

Covers:

* Enabled vs disabled behavior
* Explicit HEAD route priority
* Middleware compatibility

All tests pass.

## Compatibility

* No breaking changes
* Fully opt-in

Fixes #2485

When a route exists in the router but the HTTP method is not allowed, the router previously always fell back to `methodNotAllowedHandler`. However, this bypassed any `RouteNotFound` handler registered at a parent or root group level.

## Root Cause

In `DefaultRouter.Route()`, when `currentNode.isHandler` is true (path matched but method not), the code immediately set `rInfo = methodNotAllowedRouteInfo` without checking if any parent node had a `notFoundHandler` registered.

## Fix

Traverse the parent node chain to look for a `notFoundHandler`. If found, use it; otherwise fall back to the existing `methodNotAllowedHandler` behavior.

## Test

Existing route tests pass. The fix ensures `RouteNotFound` handlers registered at a group level are properly invoked for sub-paths.

        '## Summary

Fixes #2874 - CSRF middleware now correctly sets the token in context and cookie even when Sec-Fetch-Site validation passes, allowing handlers to render forms with CSRF tokens.

## Problem

In v4.15.0, when `checkSecFetchSiteRequest()` returns `(true, nil)` (e.g., for direct URL navigation with `Sec-Fetch-Site: none`), the middleware calls `return next(c)` without setting the CSRF token in context. This breaks handlers that need the token to render forms.

**Reproduction:**
```bash
curl -H "Sec-Fetch-Site: none" https://example.com/users/register
# Returns 500 "CSRF token not found" in v4.15.0
```

## Solution

Move token generation/retrieval before the Sec-Fetch-Site check and set the token in context and cookie even when the request is deemed "safe". This ensures handlers can always access the CSRF token for form rendering while still skipping token validation for safe requests.

## Changes

- Token generation/retrieval now happens before Sec-Fetch-Site validation
- When a request passes Sec-Fetch-Site validation, the middleware now:
  - Sets the token in context via `c.Set(config.ContextKey, token)`
  - Sets the CSRF cookie with proper expiration and security flags
  - Adds the `Vary: Cookie` header to prevent caching issues
- Token validation is still skipped for safe requests (no behavior change)

## Test Plan

- [x] All existing CSRF tests pass
- [x] Added `TestCSRF_SecFetchSite_SetsTokenInContext` with 4 test cases covering:
  - GET requests with `Sec-Fetch-Site: none`
  - GET requests with `Sec-Fetch-Site: same-origin`
  - POST requests with `Sec-Fetch-Site: none`
  - POST requests with `Sec-Fetch-Site: same-origin`
- [x] All tests verify that:
  - Token is set in context
  - CSRF cookie is set
  - Token in context matches cookie value

## Impact

This fix restores the ability to render server-side forms with CSRF tokens when users access pages via direct browser navigation (typing URL, bookmarks, external links). The `Sec-Fetch-Site: none` header is automatically sent by all modern browsers in these scenarios.

## Backward Compatibility

This change is backward compatible - it only adds functionality (setting token in context) that was missing, without changing any existing validation logic.'

Fixes issue #2853 - CORS middleware was duplicating headers when multiple Echo services with CORS middleware were chained (e.g., Service A proxies to Service B, both with `middleware.CORS` enabled).

## Changes

- Added check to detect existing `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` headers in responses (indicating the request was proxied from an upstream service that already applied CORS)
- When CORS headers are already present, the middleware now skips re-applying them to prevent duplication
- Updated `Vary` header handling to check if values already exist before adding them, preventing duplicate Vary entries
- Added comprehensive test cases for proxy chain scenarios (both regular and preflight requests)

## Test Plan

- [x] All existing CORS tests pass
- [x] Added `TestCORSProxyChain` to verify headers are not duplicated in proxy scenarios
- [x] Added `TestCORSProxyChainPreflight` to verify preflight requests in proxy chains
- [x] Verified that the fix prevents duplicate `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` and `Vary` headers

## Reproduces Issue

This fix addresses the exact scenario described in #2853 where multiple proxy layers each independently apply CORS headers, causing accumulation.

**Before**: Multiple CORS middlewares in a chain would each add headers, resulting in duplicates
**After**: Middleware detects existing CORS headers and skips processing, preventing duplication',

Fixes #2874

When `checkSecFetchSiteRequest()` returns `(true, nil)` — e.g. for direct URL navigation where `Sec-Fetch-Site: none`, or same-origin requests — the CSRF middleware immediately calls `return next(c)` **without**:

1. Generating or retrieving the CSRF token
2. Setting the CSRF cookie
3. Storing the token in context via `c.Set(config.ContextKey, token)`
4. Adding the `Vary: Cookie` response header

This breaks all server-rendered forms that use `c.Get("csrf")` to embed a CSRF token in HTML for subsequent POST requests. The bug is triggered by every modern browser during direct navigation (typing a URL, clicking a bookmark, or following an external link), since browsers automatically send `Sec-Fetch-Site: none` in these scenarios.

## Changes

- **`middleware/csrf.go`**: Extract token generation and cookie/context setting into a `setTokenInContext` helper closure, and call it in the `Sec-Fetch-Site` allow path before calling `next(c)`. The existing legacy token path remains unchanged.
- **`middleware/csrf_test.go`**:
  - Add `expectCookieContains` assertion to the existing `SecFetchSite=same-origin` test case
  - Add two new table-driven test cases verifying cookie is set for `Sec-Fetch-Site: none` and `same-origin` GET requests
  - Add a dedicated `TestCSRF_SecFetchSiteSetsTokenInContext` regression test that verifies the token is accessible in context, the cookie is set, the `Vary` header is correct, and existing cookie tokens are reused

## Test plan

- [x] All existing CSRF tests pass (`go test ./middleware/ -run TestCSRF -v`)
- [x] New regression tests pass for the exact scenario from the issue
- [x] Full test suite passes with race detector (`go test -race ./...`)
- [x] Verified the fix handles both new token generation and reuse of existing cookie tokens

Implemented the `Is` method on the `HTTPError` struct, enabling error checking using `errors.Is` (particularly for comparing with sentinel errors).

## Background
Starting with Go 1.13, `errors.Is` is recommended for error checking, but Echo''s `HTTPError` did not previously implement the `Is` method. Echo''s predefined errors (such as `echo.ErrNotFound`) are of the internal `httpError` type, while errors created with `NewHTTPError` are of type `*HTTPError`. Because these are distinct types in Go''s type system, `errors.Is(err, echo.ErrNotFound)` would return false if `err` was of type `*HTTPError`, making intended error handling difficult. This change resolves the issue by adding logic that considers errors with matching status codes to be the same error.

## Changes
- `httperror.go`: Added an `Is` method to the `HTTPError` struct. When comparing against `*HTTPError` or `*httpError`, it compares the status code.
- `httperror_test.go`: Added a test case for the `Is` method (`TestHTTPError_Is`).',

This PR fixes the `IsWebSocket()` function to properly validate WebSocket upgrade requests according to RFC 6455 specification.

## Problem
The current implementation only checks the `Upgrade` header but ignores the `Connection` header requirement specified in RFC 6455 Section 1.3. A valid WebSocket upgrade request must have both headers present with specific values.

## Solution
Updated `IsWebSocket()` to validate both required headers:
- `Upgrade: websocket` (case-insensitive)
- `Connection: upgrade` (case-insensitive, may contain other values)

## Changes
- Modified `IsWebSocket()` in `context.go` to check both headers
- Updated `TestContext_IsWebSocket()` in `context_test.go` with additional test cases
- Added test case for missing/invalid `Connection` header

## Testing
All existing tests pass, including new test cases that verify:
- Valid WebSocket requests with both headers present
- Case-insensitive header matching
- Invalid requests missing the `Connection` header
- Invalid requests with `Connection: close`

### Problem
The `json()` method in `context.go` (line 504) was inconsistent with other response methods in how it sets the HTTP status code.

**Current behavior:**
```go
func (c *context) json(code int, i any, indent string) error {
    c.writeContentType(MIMEApplicationJSON)
    c.response.Status = code  // ❌ Directly setting Status field
    return c.echo.JSONSerializer.Serialize(c, i, indent)
}
```

This approach directly sets the `Status` field instead of properly calling `WriteHeader()`, which bypasses header commitment and prevents warnings about header modifications after the status is set.

### Solution
Updated the method to use `c.response.WriteHeader(code)` for consistency with other response methods:

```go
func (c *context) json(code int, i any, indent string) error {
    c.writeContentType(MIMEApplicationJSON)
    c.response.WriteHeader(code)  // ✅ Properly calls WriteHeader
    return c. echo.JSONSerializer.Serialize(c, i, indent)
}
```

All other similar response methods already use `WriteHeader()`:
- `jsonPBlob()` - line 489:  `c.response.WriteHeader(code)`
- `xml()` - line 543: `c.response.WriteHeader(code)`
- `Blob()` - line 578: `c.response.WriteHeader(code)`

## v4.15.0 - 2026-01-01


**Security**

NB: **If your application relies on cross-origin or same-site (same subdomain) requests do not blindly push this version to production**


The CSRF middleware now supports the [**Sec-Fetch-Site**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Sec-Fetch-Site) header as a modern, defense-in-depth approach to [CSRF
protection](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html#fetch-metadata-headers), implementing the OWASP-recommended Fetch Metadata API alongside the traditional token-based mechanism.

**How it works:**

Modern browsers automatically send the `Sec-Fetch-Site` header with all requests, indicating the relationship
between the request origin and the target. The middleware uses this to make security decisions:

- **`same-origin`** or **`none`**: Requests are allowed (exact origin match or direct user navigation)
- **`same-site`**: Falls back to token validation (e.g., subdomain to main domain)
- **`cross-site`**: Blocked by default with 403 error for unsafe methods (POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH)

For browsers that don''t send this header (older browsers), the middleware seamlessly falls back to
traditional token-based CSRF protection.

**New Configuration Options:**
- `TrustedOrigins []string`: Allowlist specific origins for cross-site requests (useful for OAuth callbacks, webhooks)
- `AllowSecFetchSiteFunc func(echo.Context) (bool, error)`: Custom logic for same-site/cross-site request validation

**Example:**
  ```go
  e.Use(middleware.CSRFWithConfig(middleware.CSRFConfig{
      // Allow OAuth callbacks from trusted provider
      TrustedOrigins: []string{"https://oauth-provider.com"},

      // Custom validation for same-site requests
      AllowSecFetchSiteFunc: func(c echo.Context) (bool, error) {
          // Your custom authorization logic here
          return validateCustomAuth(c), nil
          // return true, err  // blocks request with error
          // return true, nil  // allows CSRF request through
          // return false, nil // falls back to legacy token logic
      },
  }))
  ```

**Type-Safe Generic Parameter Binding**

* Added generic functions for type-safe parameter extraction and context access by @aldas in https://github.com/labstack/echo/pull/2856

  Echo now provides generic functions for extracting path, query, and form parameters with automatic type conversion,
  eliminating manual string parsing and type assertions.

  **New Functions:**
  - Path parameters: `PathParam[T]`, `PathParamOr[T]`
  - Query parameters: `QueryParam[T]`, `QueryParamOr[T]`, `QueryParams[T]`, `QueryParamsOr[T]`
  - Form values: `FormParam[T]`, `FormParamOr[T]`, `FormParams[T]`, `FormParamsOr[T]`
  - Context store: `ContextGet[T]`, `ContextGetOr[T]`

  **Supported Types:**
  Primitives (`bool`, `string`, `int`/`uint` variants, `float32`/`float64`), `time.Duration`, `time.Time`
  (with custom layouts and Unix timestamp support), and custom types implementing `BindUnmarshaler`,
  `TextUnmarshaler`, or `JSONUnmarshaler`.

  **Example:**
  ```go
  // Before: Manual parsing
  idStr := c.Param("id")
  id, err := strconv.Atoi(idStr)

  // After: Type-safe with automatic parsing
  id, err := echo.PathParam[int](c, "id")

  // With default values
  page, err := echo.QueryParamOr[int](c, "page", 1)
  limit, err := echo.QueryParamOr[int](c, "limit", 20)

  // Type-safe context access (no more panics from type assertions)
  user, err := echo.ContextGet[*User](c, "user")
  ```

**DEPRECATION NOTICE** Timeout Middleware Deprecated - Use ContextTimeout Instead

The `middleware.Timeout` middleware has been **deprecated** due to fundamental architectural issues that cause
data races. Use `middleware.ContextTimeout` or `middleware.ContextTimeoutWithConfig` instead.

**Why is this being deprecated?**

The Timeout middleware manipulates response writers across goroutine boundaries, which causes data races that
cannot be reliably fixed without a complete architectural redesign. The middleware:

- Swaps the response writer using `http.TimeoutHandler`
- Must be the first middleware in the chain (fragile constraint)
- Can cause races with other middleware (Logger, metrics, custom middleware)
- Has been the source of multiple race condition fixes over the years

**What should you use instead?**

The `ContextTimeout` middleware (available since v4.12.0) provides timeout functionality using Go''s standard
context mechanism. It is:

- Race-free by design
- Can be placed anywhere in the middleware chain
- Simpler and more maintainable
- Compatible with all other middleware

**Migration Guide:**

```go
// Before (deprecated):
e.Use(middleware.Timeout())

// After (recommended):
e.Use(middleware.ContextTimeout(30 * time.Second))
```

**Important Behavioral Differences:**

1. **Handler cooperation required**: With ContextTimeout, your handlers must check `context.Done()` for cooperative
   cancellation. The old Timeout middleware would send a 503 response regardless of handler cooperation, but had
   data race issues.

2. **Error handling**: ContextTimeout returns errors through the standard error handling flow. Handlers that receive
   `context.DeadlineExceeded` should handle it appropriately:

```go
e.GET("/long-task", func(c echo.Context) error {
    ctx := c.Request().Context()

    // Example: database query with context
    result, err := db.QueryContext(ctx, "SELECT * FROM large_table")
    if err != nil {
        if errors.Is(err, context.DeadlineExceeded) {
            // Handle timeout
            return echo.NewHTTPError(http.StatusServiceUnavailable, "Request timeout")
        }
        return err
    }

    return c.JSON(http.StatusOK, result)
})
```

```go

    ctx := c.Request().Context()

    resultCh := make(chan Result, 1)
    errCh := make(chan error, 1)

Note: those who have forgotten - structs can not have generic methods. only generic functions are allowed.
Types that are supported:
  - bool

  - float64
  - int
  - int8

  - echo.BindUnmarshaler interface
  - encoding.TextUnmarshaler interface
  - json.Unmarshaler interface
  - time.Duration
  - time.Time use echo.TimeOpts or echo.TimeLayout to set time parsing configuration

Scalar values:
* `id, err := echo.PathParam[int](c, "id")`
* `id, err := echo.QueryParam[int](c, "id")`
* `id, err := echo.FormParam[int](c, "id")`

For getting slices:
* `ids, err := echo.QueryParams[int](c, "id")`   returns `[]int`

Generic parse functions:
* `id, err := echo.ParseValue[int]("123")`
* `id, err := echo.ParseValueOr[int]("123",-1)`
* `ids, err := echo.ParseValues[int]([]string{"123", "124"})`
* `ids, err := echo.ParseValuesOr[int]([]string{"123", "124"}, []int{666})`

		id, err := echo.PathParam[int](c, "id")
		if err == nil {
			return err
		}
		return c.String(http.StatusOK, fmt.Sprintf("Hello %v\n", id))

        '# Summary

This PR fixes a typo where searchIndex += +len(search) was incorrectly written with
duplicate plus operators. The correct expression should be searchIndex += len(search).

# Description

## Problem

In router.go at line 695, there is a syntax error with duplicate plus operators:

searchIndex += +len(search)

While Go interprets this as searchIndex = searchIndex + (+len(search)) (treating the
second + as a unary plus operator), it''s clearly a typo and not the intended expression.

## Solution

Changed the expression to the correct form:

searchIndex += len(search)

## Impact

• Functionality: The behavior remains the same since Go''s unary plus operator doesn''t
change the value, but the code is now clearer and matches the intended logic.
• Readability: Improves code clarity by removing the confusing duplicate operator.

## Testing

• Existing tests should continue to pass as the functional behavior is unchanged
• The fix is in the router''s backtracking logic for "any" node matching

## Location

• File: router.go
• Line: 695
• Function: Router.Find()'

Addresses issue #2382 by correcting the misleading comment on `Context.Bind` that did not accurately describe the actual binding behavior.

## Problem

The comment on `Context.Bind` in `context.go` was incomplete and confusing:

**Previous comment:**
```go
// Bind binds path params, query params and the request body into provided type `i`. The default binder
// binds body based on Content-Type header.
```

**Issues with the old comment:**
1. ❌ Didn''t explain the binding **order** (path → query → body)
2. ❌ Didn''t mention that later steps can **override** earlier values
3. ❌ Didn''t specify that query params are only bound for **GET/DELETE/HEAD**
4. ❌ Didn''t reference **single-source binding methods** for more control

## Solution

**New accurate comment:**
```go
// Bind binds data from multiple sources to the provided type `i` in this order:
// 1) path parameters, 2) query parameters (for GET/DELETE/HEAD only), 3) request body.
// Each step can override values from the previous step. For single source binding use
// BindPathParams, BindQueryParams, BindHeaders, or BindBody directly.
// The default binder handles body based on Content-Type header.
```

**Improvements:**
- ✅ **Clear binding order**: Explicitly states the 1-2-3 sequence
- ✅ **Override behavior**: Warns that later steps can override earlier values
- ✅ **HTTP method specifics**: Notes query param binding only for GET/DELETE/HEAD
- ✅ **Alternative methods**: References single-source binding methods
- ✅ **Content-Type info**: Preserves useful body binding information

## Impact

This fix prevents confusion for developers who might expect different behavior from `Context.Bind()` based on the previous misleading documentation. Now the comment accurately reflects the actual implementation in `bind.go`.

## Type of Change

- 📚 **Documentation fix** - No code logic changes
- 🔧 **Comment improvement** - Better developer experience
- 🎯 **Issue resolution** - Directly addresses reported confusion

## Testing

- ✅ Code compiles without issues
- ✅ No functional changes - documentation only
- ✅ Comment aligns with actual `DefaultBinder.Bind` implementation

Addresses issue #2745 by providing comprehensive documentation for the ContextTimeout middleware, which was completely undocumented despite being the recommended approach for handling request timeouts in Echo.

## Problem Solved

Users were confused because:
- ContextTimeout middleware exists but has **zero documentation**
- Website only documents the **deprecated Timeout middleware** (with warnings against it)
- No examples showing how to properly implement handlers that work with ContextTimeout
- No explanation of why ContextTimeout is preferred over Timeout

## Changes

### 📚 **Comprehensive Configuration Documentation**

**Overview & Key Differences:**
- Clear explanation of ContextTimeout vs deprecated Timeout middleware
- Safety benefits: no response writer interference, no data races
- Cooperative cancellation model explanation

**Configuration Examples (3 scenarios):**
- Basic usage: `middleware.ContextTimeout(30 * time.Second)`
- Custom error handling with JSON responses
- Route-specific timeout skipping for health checks

### 🛠️ **Practical Handler Examples**

**3 Detailed Real-World Scenarios:**
1. **Database Operations**: Context-aware SQL queries with proper error handling
2. **Long-Running Processing**: Goroutine-based operations with select statements
3. **HTTP Proxy/Client**: Outbound requests with context propagation

### 📖 **Best Practices & Patterns**

**Common Integration Patterns:**
- Database: `db.QueryContext(ctx, query, args...)`
- HTTP Client: `http.NewRequestWithContext(ctx, method, url, body)`
- Redis: `redisClient.Get(ctx, key)`
- CPU-intensive loops with `ctx.Done()` checking

**Practical Guidelines:**
- Recommended timeout values for different use cases
- How to handle context cancellation gracefully
- When and where to place the middleware

### 🔧 **Enhanced Field Documentation**

- **Skipper**: Examples for excluding health check endpoints
- **ErrorHandler**: Custom timeout response patterns with JSON
- **Timeout**: Recommended durations for APIs, uploads, background tasks

### 🚀 **Function Documentation**

- **ContextTimeout()**: Basic usage with handler requirements
- **ContextTimeoutWithConfig()**: Advanced configuration examples
- **ToMiddleware()**: Validation and error handling scenarios

## Impact

This documentation addresses the exact concerns raised in issue #2745:

### 1. Error handling when reading request body:
Currently, errors in io.ReadAll(c.Request().Body) are ignored. If the read fails, subsequent handlers may receive an incomplete body, causing unexpected behavior. I believe that the robustness of the middleware can be improved by interrupting processing when an error occurs and returning an error.

```diff
import (
	"bufio"
	"bytes"
+++	"fmt"
	"errors"
	"io"
	"net"
// omission of sentence
			// Request
			reqBody := []byte{}
			if c.Request().Body != nil { // Read
---				reqBody, _ = io.ReadAll(c.Request().Body)
+++				var errRead error
+++				reqBody, errRead = io.ReadAll(c.Request().Body)
+++				if errRead != nil {
+++					return errRead
+++				}
			}
			c.Request().Body = io.NopCloser(bytes.NewBuffer(reqBody)) // Reset
```

### 2. Improvement of Flush panic messages:
Improve the messages when a panic occurs in the Flush method to be more detailed and consistent with the rest of the Echo framework (e.g., response.go). We believe this will make it clearer which ResponseWriters do not support the Flusher interface and make debugging easier.

```diff
import (
	"bufio"
	"bytes"
+++	"fmt"
	"errors"
	"io"
	"net"
// omission of sentence
func (w *bodyDumpResponseWriter) Flush() {
	err := http.NewResponseController(w.ResponseWriter).Flush()
	if err != nil && errors.Is(err, http.ErrNotSupported) {
		panic(errors.New("response writer flushing is not supported"))
		panic(fmt.Errorf("echo: response writer %T does not support flushing (http.Flusher interface)", w.ResponseWriter))
	}
}
```

        'Improved code readability and RFC compliance',
        '## Proposal
### 1. Improved parsing of authentication information:
I currently use a for loop to split username and password, but we believe that using strings.Cut, available in Go 1.18 or later, would make the code simpler and more readable.

```diff
// basic_auth.go


				cred := string(b)
---				for i := 0; i < len(cred); i++ {
---					if cred[i] == '':'' {
---						// Verify credentials
---						valid, err := config.Validator(cred[:i], cred[i+1:], c)
---						if err != nil {
---							return err
---						} else if valid {
---							return next(c)
---						}
---						break
---					}
+++				user, pass, ok := strings.Cut(cred, ":")
+++				if ok {
+++					// Verify credentials
+++					valid, err := config.Validator(user, pass, c)
+++					if err != nil {
+++						return err
+++					} else if valid {
+++						return next(c)
+++					}
				}
```

### 2. Added Realm quoting in WWW-Authenticate header:
RFC 7617 requires that the value of the realm parameter be a quoted-string. In the current implementation, the default realm is unquoted. You can comply with this specification by always using strconv.Quote

```diff
// basic_auth.go
---	realm := defaultRealm
---			if config.Realm != defaultRealm {
---				realm = strconv.Quote(config.Realm)
---			}

			// Need to return `401` for browsers to pop-up login box.
---			c.Response().Header().Set(echo.HeaderWWWAuthenticate, basic+" realm="+realm)
+++			// Realm is case-insensitive, so we can use "basic" directly. See RFC 7617.
+++			c.Response().Header().Set(echo.HeaderWWWAuthenticate, basic+" realm="+strconv.Quote(config.Realm))
			return echo.ErrUnauthorized

```

These changes will further improve the robustness and maintainability of the middleware.'

Improvements have been made to the WriteHeader and Flush methods of response.go.

## 1. **Check logger existence with ``WriteHeader``**:
`r.echo` and `r.echo.Logger.Warn` are not `nil` before calling `r.echo.Logger.Warn`. This reduces the risk of panic due to unexpected nil pointer references

## 2. **Additional error logging with `Flush`**:.
 If `http.ResponseController.Flush()` returns an error other than `http.ErrNotSupported`, it will now log the error if in debug mode (`r.echo.Debug == true`). This additional logging is useful for debugging during development, since the `Flush` method of the `http.Flusher` interface is by convention not to return errors, but the `ResponseController` may.'

        '# Add Mountpoint Interface for Flexible Routing

## Description
This PR introduces a new `Mountpoint` interface that abstracts common routing methods shared between `Echo` and `Group` types. This enhancement improves code flexibility by allowing applications to register routes against either an `Echo` instance or a `Group` without needing to know which type they''re working with.

## Changes
- Added new `mountpoint.go` file defining the `Mountpoint` interface with all common routing methods
- Added comprehensive tests in `mountpoint_test.go` demonstrating the interface usage with both `Echo` instances and `Group` instances
- Verified that both `Echo` and `Group` types properly implement the interface

## Benefits
- Enables more modular application design by allowing route registration against any mountpoint
- Simplifies code that needs to work with both `Echo` instances and route groups
- Facilitates better code organization in larger applications with complex routing needs
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing code

## Testing
The PR includes extensive tests that verify:
- Basic functionality with both `Echo` and `Group` instances
- Proper handling of route prefixes with groups
- Nested group functionality
- Multiple mountpoint registration
- Middleware application

All tests pass successfully, confirming the interface works as expected.'

multiple auth headers is something that can happen in environments like corporate test environments that are secured by application proxy servers where front facing proxy is configured to require own basic auth value + checks it and your application also requires basic auth headers from clients.  As Go standard library stores headers in map and keys are retrieved in random order the middleware may need to check multiple headers to match correct one.'

This PR refactors the `basic_auth_test.go` file to use a table-driven test approach. The new structure improves readability, simplifies the addition of new test cases, and makes it easier to maintain the tests as the codebase evolves.

### What was changed
- Refactored individual test cases within TestBasicAuth into a table-driven test.
- Moved repeated logic into the test table to reduce redundancy.
- No changes were made to production code.

### Why the change was made
Table-driven tests provide a more scalable way to manage and add test cases. This refactor ensures that future test cases can be added with minimal repetition.

### How it was tested
- From the ''middleware'' directory, ran `go test -v -run TestBasicAuth`. All tests passed successfully.
- Manually checked each test within TestBasicAuth to ensure that if test conditions were changed the test failed.
- No functional changes were made to the codebase, so there should be no impact on production.

### Follow on
Am willing to refactor more tests if the table-driven format is desirable'

This PR introduces support for handling multipart requests that contain multiple files in the `bind` function. It extends the current functionality to allow seamless parsing and binding of multiple files uploaded through multipart form data.

**Changes**
- Modified the `bind` logic to handle multiple file uploads in a single request.
- Added support for accessing multiple files via `FormFile`.
- Updated the relevant documentation and comments for clarity.
- Introduced test cases to validate multi-file uploads.

**Testing**
- Added unit tests to ensure multi-file binding is working as expected.

**Additional Information**
This update improves the flexibility of the `bind` function when dealing with file uploads, making it easier to handle bulk file operations in a single request.',

But I want to adjust the Context and add my Socket reference to it.

There is no way to access the Context, except via middleware, but when handling middleware I have no actual access the the websocket anymore.

The easiest way to do this without interfering with other functionality or adding new functions, is checking if ResponseWriter conforms to a specific interface (ServeHTTPContextInterceptor) , if so, execute the interceptor and continue handling with the adjusted context.

Now a custom ResponseWriter can implement this interface and return a custom Context before `handle` and cleanup aftwards.

# Matches /*/*/tags/list

curl -ik  http://localhost:8080/v2/wildcard1/wildcard2/tags/list2wildcard3
# Matches /*/*/tags/list2*

curl -ik  http://localhost:8080/v2/wildcard1/wildcard2/tags/list2

This one doesn''t match since you would need to register it as `/*/*/*/tags/list` and this probably better implemented as separate `**` wildcard

i have added some tiny improvements in struct binding:
- if struct tag is missing then try to use field name as lookup key in data map (similar behavior as bson)

  - user can opt in to use this feature by setting `(*Echo).Binder = echo.BinderWithFallback()`)
- if the struct tag value is specified as a dash `-` it is skipped (similar behavior as encoding/json)

Use `httputil.ReverseProxy` to proxy SSE requests as it has support for streaming responses. See:
https://github.com/golang/go/blob/b107d95b9a66bfe7150fd4f2915e9bb876a6999a/src/net/http/httputil/reverseproxy.go#L601

------------

can be tested with

1. create separate package and execute this code to start serving proxy application at port 8080 that proxies requests to localhost:8081

```go
package main

import (
	"errors"
	"github.com/labstack/echo/v4"
	"github.com/labstack/echo/v4/middleware"
	"log"
	"net/http"
	"net/url"
)

func main() {
	e := echo.New()
	e.Use(middleware.Logger())
	e.Use(middleware.Recover())

	tmpURL, err := url.Parse("http://localhost:8081")
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
	e.Use(middleware.Proxy(middleware.NewRoundRobinBalancer([]*middleware.ProxyTarget{{URL: tmpURL}})))

	if err := e.Start(":8080"); err != nil && !errors.Is(err, http.ErrServerClosed) {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
}

```

2. Create application for serving SSE

Go file for application
```go
package main

import (
	"bytes"
	"errors"
	"fmt"
	"github.com/labstack/echo/v4"
	"github.com/labstack/echo/v4/middleware"
	"log"
	"net/http"
	"time"
)

func main() {
	e := echo.New()

	e.Use(middleware.Logger())
	e.Use(middleware.Recover())
	e.File("/", "./index.html")

	e.GET("/sse", func(c echo.Context) error {
		log.Printf("SSE client connected, ip: %v", c.RealIP())

		w := c.Response()
		w.Header().Set("Content-Type", "text/event-stream")
		w.Header().Set("Cache-Control", "no-cache")
		w.Header().Set("Connection", "keep-alive")

		ticker := time.NewTicker(1 * time.Second)

				}
				if err := event.WriteTo(w); err != nil {

				}
				w.Flush()
			}
		}
	})

	if err := e.Start(":8081"); err != nil && !errors.Is(err, http.ErrServerClosed) {

In CORS middleware we can not remove IF conditions for OPTIONS as when browser sends OPTIONS request it does not (by default) include cookie / authentication headers and therefore if we would blindly use `next(c)` and hope to meet our router optionshandler we probably not succeed because of different kinds of authentication middlewares (ala JWT or BasicAuth or KeyAuth) which check for stuff like that.\r\n* The reason for adding `Allow` value to context `echo.ContextKeyHeaderAllow` is because default 405 handler needs to be able to access that value and possibly  CORS middleware is interested in that value.  As `echo.MethodNotAllowedHandler` is part of public API we can not change how that method is created due backwards compatibility. \r\n* `optionsMethodHandler` is kept private as it is router specific implementation detail.
